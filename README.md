Forensic Imaging quickstarts!

## Standards Bodies
- US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
- NIST has the program: Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT)
- ISO (ISO/IEC 27037:2012) (provides guidlines)
- UK - Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) - Provides: ACPO *Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence*
- DOJ maintains *Electronic Crime Scene Investigation: A Guide fo First Responders*
- Research journal (academic): *Digital Investigation: The International Journal of Digital Forensic & Incident Response*
- Conference: Digital Forensics Research Workshop (DFRWS)

### For the private sector
- Assurance Advisory Council (IAAC) provides: *Directors and Corporate Advisors' Guide to Digital Investigations and Evidence*
- Legal: US Sarbanes-Oxley legislation

To note:
> Each industry from healthcare to telecom to banking will have different standards and regulations.

For banking as an example: Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)

**CFTT** is for the establishment of methodologies for testing computer forensic software tools by development of general tool specifications, test procedures, test criteria, test sets, and test hardware.

## Open Source (Linux) vs Commercial forensic software
### Advantages (Open Source)
- Accessible to anyone
- Examine the code is possible
- No need to sign nondisclosure agreements
- You can modify the source code
    - Easier to automate
    - You can more easily integrate with other software
    - You can modify the code to meet the requirements of a particular forensic lab
- You have mailing lists, chat other types of forums
- Ideal for academic
- Development community work with each other even if tehy compete
### Disadvantages (Open Source)
- Support is not reliable nor accurate nor trustworty (at times)
    - Commercial software often have 24/7 support and is more reliable
- Reaching out to the public to get help you could reveal sensitive information
- Interoperability with proprietary technologies with open source is often incomplete or not implementing some function properly
- Some project are abandoned or neglected (e.g.: OpenSSL)
- When in court the commercial software company can defend their product
- Open Source is better for educational reasons
